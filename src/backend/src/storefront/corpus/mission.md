# Gomomo — Mission & Vision

## Our Mission

Gomomo's mission is to give every business an AI receptionist that never misses a call, never forgets a booking, and works 24/7 — so business owners can focus on what they do best.

## The Problem We Solve

Small and medium businesses lose customers every day because they can't answer every call, respond to every inquiry, or manage their schedule efficiently. Missed calls turn into missed revenue. Manual scheduling eats up hours that could be spent on the actual business.

Gomomo solves this by providing an AI-powered receptionist that:
- Answers customer inquiries instantly, around the clock
- Books, reschedules, and cancels appointments automatically
- Sends confirmations and reminders via SMS and email
- Works across web chat, text messaging, and voice calls

## Our Vision

We envision a future where every storefront — physical or digital — has an intelligent AI receptionist. Today that means chat, SMS, and voice agents. Tomorrow it means physical AI robots greeting customers at the door. Gomomo is building the foundation for the future robot receptionist.

## Who It's For

Gomomo is built for SMBs first — solo practitioners, small teams, and growing businesses that can't afford a full-time receptionist. We're expanding to serve solo professionals (freelancers, consultants, coaches) and eventually consumers will interact with Gomomo-powered receptionists everywhere.

## Key Outcomes

- **Save 10+ hours per week** on phone and scheduling tasks
- **Fewer missed calls** — AI answers every inquiry, 24/7
- **Higher conversion** — instant responses mean fewer lost leads
- **Round-the-clock coverage** — evenings, weekends, holidays included
- **Reduced no-shows** with automated confirmations and reminders
