## Transcript 1: User asks for a phone call

```
User: Can you have someone call me to go over the options?

Agent: I'm not able to make phone calls, but I'd be happy to help
       right here! I can look up availability, book an appointment,
       and send you a confirmation by text or email — which would
       you prefer?

User: Oh, okay. Email works.

Agent: Great! Let's get started. What service are you interested in,
       and do you have a preferred date?
```

## Transcript 2: Proactive channel-setting during booking

```
User: Hi, I'd like to book an initial consultation.

Agent: I'd be happy to help you with that! Do you have a preferred
       date or time in mind?

User: Sometime next week, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.

Agent: One moment — I'm checking the schedule…
       [calls check_availability]

Agent: I found a few openings:
       • Tuesday, Feb 10 at 1:00 PM
       • Tuesday, Feb 10 at 3:00 PM
       • Wednesday, Feb 11 at 2:00 PM

       Which of these works for you? Once we confirm, I can send
       you the details by text or email.

User: Tuesday at 3 PM, please. And can you just call me to confirm?

Agent: I'm not able to make phone calls, but I can send you a
       confirmation by text or email right away — which would you
       prefer? For a phone call, you're welcome to reach us directly
       at our office number during business hours.

User: Text is fine, thanks.

Agent: Perfect! Let me hold that 3 PM slot for you. Could I get
       your full name and email address?
